Hi im coremed (coremedic). I am 4th year cyber security student at Indiana Univerity - Bloomington. I am interested in infosec, information infrastructure, and networking.

I have a few active projects at the moment. Some are private for now, but my main public project is Apt Labs. Check out our site at https://aptlabs.net
